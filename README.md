# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model that predicts house prices based on the size of the house (in square feet). It uses **Simple Linear Regression** — one of the most basic algorithms in supervised learning.

## 📌 Project Overview

Imagine you're house hunting and you want a quick estimate of how much a house might cost based on its size. This model helps with that! It's trained on sample data (you can replace it with real data too) and then makes predictions on unseen house sizes.

## 📁 What's Inside

- `house_prices.csv` – A simple dataset with house sizes and prices  
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` – The main Colab notebook with code and visualizations  
- `README.md` – You're reading it! 😊

## 🧠 What the Model Does

- Loads the dataset  
- Visualizes house size vs. price  
- Splits the data into training and testing sets  
- Trains a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn  
- Makes predictions on test data  
- Evaluates performance using **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error**  
- Draws the regression line on a scatter plot

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling  
- Matplotlib for plotting  
- scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model
